# yt-dlpPS

This repo contains the PowerShell file that I use to download an YouTube video with the help of [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). It makes everything easier for me. I don't have to type everything everytime.
Powershell v7, FFmpeg, Ffprobe is needed to use this.


Put `yt-dlp.exe` in the folder where you will run this script and make a folder named
`bin`
That folder, keep `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe`
